Dialog:
	Private/password server connect


Server Browser:
	Better mastermode icons
	Redo filters section to fit server desc and map search filters
	Ponder whether to bother about favorites since nothing is being done about it


Options:
	Scratch the whole thing and assemble a list of viable options
	Think of proper categorising for the various options
	Possible add advanced view


Controls:
	List all controls or allow the user to view info on each key?
		For the former, too much space is required, scroll area not very intuitive
			Entries require more explanation due to increased complexity
		For the latter, maybe color code the keys to make searching faster?


Screenshot:
	Toggle screenshot mode with F12
	Automatically hide UI and HUD, restore afterwards
	Lag compensation


Scoreboard:
	Port that thing to a more standard UI look that matches the rest
	Fix broken stuff, namely almost everything which doesn't show up
	Less text size disparity and variables
	Recycle more code and shorten operations where possible
