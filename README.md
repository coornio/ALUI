  ALUI is a mod meant for the game Tesseract whose aim is to improve the user experience and flexibility
of using the menus by taking the capabilities of CubeScript and nnUI elements to new heights and delivering
a powerful platform upon which to create and enjoy more immersive control and customization while
simultaneously allowing for code to remain reusable.

Its execution has been inspired by HTML and CSS, and while it doesn't cover the entirety of the functions
the library offers, the most important of the commands can be styled easily from a predetermined style.cfg.
Anyone can easily fiddle around with the color values and create an entirely different looking UI in a jiffy!

Most non-default nnUI functions are defined inside lib.cfg, and the style options inside style.cfg.

This is not just a library for use. Included in the project is all the actual menus meant to replace the defaults
of Tesseract, and thus the purpose of this repository as both a place to commit changes and as a download.
